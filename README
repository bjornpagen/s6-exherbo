# Policy for s6/s6-rc on Exherbo
Licensed under the terms of the Zero Clause BSD License

## Goals:

- Paludis

s6-exherbo sole purpose is to provide an automated way for paludis to interact
with service management via exlibs. Not done yet.

- Mimic upstream/adhere to UNIXisms

This means that we keep naming conventions like rc.*, and we keep the same
names for files/dirs as s6-linux-init defines them to be.

- Stay user-configurable

We keep most files in /etc, because regardless of whether it is a good idea
or not, changing s6-exherbo files should be hassle-free.

- Stay s6

Avoid using tools like sh/coreutils. POSIX is great, but s6-* is better.
